  <h1>💜 Sohaa... bas ek baar padho bhi aur suno bhii 💜</h1>
  <p>Sohaa,</p>

  <p>It was a very bad day… until I saw you for the first time.<br>
  That single moment — turned my entire day into the best one ever.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what exactly happened within me…<br>
  But something shifted, something special — something my heart couldn’t explain.</p>

  <p>I truly wanted to talk to you…<br>
  But life had other plans.<br>
  Things went in a way that forced me to wait —<br>
  <strong>4 long years</strong>… just to finally speak with you.</p>

  <p>And then, Allah — in His perfect timing —<br>
  Made that moment happen.<br>
  <strong>You called me…</strong><br>
  And Soha, the second I saw your name flash on my screen, I was stunned.</p>

  <p>I had already saved your number…<br>
  I whispered to myself:<br>
  <em>"Soha is calling me? Why would she call me?"</em><br>
  I went crazy, Soha — I really did.</p>

  <p>And when we talked…<br>
  That voice of yours…<br>
  So soft, so sweet — just like my Mumma’s gulab jamun.<br>
  I couldn’t help but fall.</p>

  <p>Yes, I know… we both knew it wasn’t right.<br>
  But I couldn’t control it, Sohaa.<br>
  Somewhere between all those conversations…<br>
  That like slowly turned into love.</p>

  <p>I started imagining a future with you<br>
  The moment I realized:<br>
  <strong>You are the one for me.</strong></p>

  <p>Yes… I fell first.<br>
  And I fall harder… every single time.<br>
  But when you fell — you fell softly, beautifully.</p>

  <p><strong>May 5th —</strong><br>
  The day you realized it…<br>
  Became the most unforgettable day of my life. 💜</p>

  <p><em>Shayad likhne se kabhi sab kuch nahi keh paaya...<br>
  Par is awaaz mein mera asli dil hai...<br>
  Aapke liye... sirf aapke liye 💌</em></p>
