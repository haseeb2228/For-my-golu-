  <h1>💜 Sohaa... bas ek baar sunlo 💜</h1>
  <p>
  
Sohaa,
It was a very bad day… until I saw you for the first time.
That single moment — turned my entire day into the best one ever.

I don’t know what exactly happened within me…
But something shifted, something special — something my heart couldn’t explain.

I truly wanted to talk to you…
But life had other plans.
Things went in a way that forced me to wait —
4 long years… just to finally speak with you.

And then, Allah — in His perfect timing —
Made that moment happen.
You called me…
And Soha, the second I saw your name flash on my screen,
I was stunned.

I had already saved your number…
I whispered to myself:
"Soha is calling me? Why would she call me?"
I went crazy, Soha — I really did.

And when we talked…
That voice of yours…
So soft, so sweet — just like my Mumma’s gulab jamun.
I couldn’t help but fall.

Yes, I know… we both knew it wasn’t right.
But I couldn’t control it, Sohaa.
Somewhere between all those conversations…
That like slowly turned into love.

I started imagining a future with you
The moment I realized:
You are the one for me.

Yes… I fell first.
And I fall harder… every single time.
But when you fell — you fell softly, beautifully.

May 5th —
The day you realized it…
Became the most unforgettable day of my life. 💜
    
    \n  Shayad likhne se kabhi sab kuch nahi keh paaya...  
    Par is awaaz mein mera asli dil hai...  
    Aapke liye... sirf aapke liye 💌
